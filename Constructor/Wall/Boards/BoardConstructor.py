    Cut Dimenstional Lumber Generator

    Function for creating lengths of dimensional lumber at given length.

    Args:
        name (str): given name for board
        profile (str): board profile - e.g. "2x4", the profile is read from the CSV file which brings in depth and width information
        length (tup): the length the board is to be given in a tuple as length and unit of measure ment

    Raises:
        None

    Returns:
        tuple of Workplane object representing extruded board of selected profile, board name, and board profile data.

    TODO:
        (üó∏) Add parameters to create multiple boards with single call to function
        (üó∏) Add unit conversion
                - It has been added but needs improvement
        (-) Add parameters for placement: position, rotation, angle, etc.
                - Partially added . . . when multiple boards are created they are evenly spaced apart with the 'distribution' parameter
        (‚òê) Distribute multiple boards
        (‚òê) Add extension to modify ends with compound miter cuts
        (‚òê) Add extension to modify profiles
        (‚òê) Add extension to add notches, holes, or arbitrary cut outs
        (‚òê) Add export/view option
        (‚òê) Make path for 'material_profiles_lumber_boards.csv' dynamic
        (‚òê) Implement error checking
        (‚òê) Add tests
        (‚òê) Output log data
        (‚òê) Reimplement as a class
        (‚òê) Possibly add more lumber profiles to csv data
        (‚òê) Add parameter for color
            ! AttributeError: 'Workplane' object has no attribute 'Color'
        (‚òê) Refine documentation
